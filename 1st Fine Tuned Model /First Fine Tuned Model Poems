’m not ready to say goodbye I’m sorry I’m sorry
I could not possibly be more thankful for your absence
I can only hope that today is your lucky day
I’m sorry for the distance between you and me I’m
sorry for the absence of answers Answer: I don’t know
how to feel without limitations Because as your body fills
my body With joy And comfort You remind me I’ve

 I’ll come back in August and say I want
to have a cup of tea. You’re welcome here. When
I say welcome you’re supposed to be thankful. I’m sorry

phone. Sometimes we are missing the other half: joy in
the absence of sadness: myself in the bathtub soaking in
warm water, and a bagful of mangoes on my hands
as I place them around my neck.

a tall boy gets a new job at
a large blue gas station. and eventually the store becomes
a gas station. we want to know if that is
how it all started. a man holds a box of
quarters in his left hand. the box was supposed to
hold the keys to heaven. now he holds the crow
who found the crow in the kitchen sink. we
are in the desert and need a place to stay.
the radio asks what is happening in the desert and
we ask what is happening in the rest of the
world. I don’t have a way back to heaven. the
sun bear is not there to bear the forgotten book.
and the star fruit on the screen are not written
