**AI Poetry Generator**

The following is a series of gpt2 models trained and fine tuned on a corpus/a of original poetry with the goal of mimicking the voice of the corpus.

**Introduction**

If the canonization of a writer’s work allows the work to live forever, then AI has the ability to allow for a writer’s work to live endlessly. 

The goal for this project is to explore the possibilities of AI and human collaboration in the realm of creative works (poetry). 

**Background**

Created in collaboration with chatgpt the following project contains training sets, poem creator codes, and their outputs for a series of gp2 models. Each model was trained on a variant of an original corpus of around 300 single authored works (poems). 

In total there are 4 different models which represent progressive sets of additional training with new perimeters during the training sessions. 


**Contents**

With this folder there are subfolders which contain the following 

-Training code: the code used to train the model 

-Poem Generator Code: code used to test the model

-Outputs: a series of poems created from the test code 

-Corpus/a: the corpus/a which the model was trained on 


**Additional Possibilities**:

Add New Corpus into the composition process - I would like to create a model which is trained on the same poetry datasets, but then the actual vocab of the output composition are based upon another corpus… ie. a poem in the style of the writer, but only using vocab from a medical dictionary, gov. doc. etc. 

User Inputs - I would like to further explore line by line or word by word composition with the user having more input on the poems creation 

Final Produce Idea: a virtual environment, in the style of an e-book where poems with permenter titles regenerate and create new poems - based on user input. 

Example: 

Title: Person goes to the Hospital 

-User inputs reason for visit 

-Poem generates in the style of the model’s training, but only using vocab from a medical textbook.

Some Highlights of the outputs

Untitled

the sonnet sleeps on the moon.
The sun bear dreams
of a star fruit tree.
In the forest trees limp
onto the river.
The sun bear can only dream about
the trees on his own.
But the man who bears
his fruit says theres no such thing as sunlight on
the moon.
The sky is filled with the sounds of
mans dying breath.
To the northwind the bears cubs are
fed fresh julyberries, then turn them into july trees.


**Untitled**

I don’t know what else to do with my life.
In my village
I’m surrounded by tall trees
and the absence of trees
of course means nothing.

**Untitled**

the sun bear feels like a boss and is very
fulfilling in his day job.
When the sun bears are
busy they sell cars, and use their weekends to socialize
with new coworkers.
Eventually they will be in love and
the attention will be on each other.
The sun bear
trades old friends to new and likes new places more.
He likes the company of others who can relate to
him.
He sees himself as a better bear: a slightly
younger sun bear who is more presentable and pleasant, but
also still hungry for attention.

**You know the poems of poems that have no meaning.**

You want to know what you’ve heard?
The world you are imagining is not real.
The world you are imagining is
different.
There is no forest or river,
the river is over the ground.
There is no land to
to the bedroom door.
She snatches her phone off the ground, stares at the screen, and texts back,
with the last line: Thank you for coming.

The god of the bones is
a dog.

**The Biggest Problem**

There are a lot of different sun bears in my workplace. I ask them why they like the sun bear-ness of the sun bear, and they say
that because the sun bears are always wearing suits, and because the
sun bears can’

**Poem Log #3**

I am in love with a sad poem
that has a lot of language in it.
I love the way the poem is about two
lovebirds. One is sad and the other is happy.
My poem partner has a dog and I don’t know why.
I want to find out why.
why. this is my home. i mean this as if it’s my home. i’ve never been so overwhelmed by the language i speak
about language. in fact, i wish i could just say hello and i would be thankful for the warmth of our voicemails.
i am sorry that my home’s words are not my best, but i will be thankful for the lack of
exactly what i said to you. i am sorry
sorry for the bear
but I’m glad he is alive.
